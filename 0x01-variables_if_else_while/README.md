# 0x01 C - variables, if, else, while

In this project, I will explore variables and control structures (if, else, while)

## What each scripts do?

* 0-positive_or_negative.c: prints whether the number in the variable `n` is positive, negative or zero
* 1-last_digit.c: print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`
* 2-print_alphabet.c: prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line using `putchar` function
