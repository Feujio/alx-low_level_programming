# 0x01 C - variables, if, else, while

In this project, I will explore variables and control structures (if, else, while)

## What each scripts do?

* `0-positive_or_negative.c`: prints whether the number in the variable `n` is positive, negative or zero
* `1-last_digit.c`: print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`
* `2-print_alphabet.c`: prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line using `putchar` function
* `3-print_alphabets.c`: prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line
* `4-print_alphabet.c`: prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Print all except `q` and `e`
* `5-print_numbers.c`: prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line
* `6-print_numberz.c`: prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line. Only use `putchar` function
* `7-print_tebahpla.c`: prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. only use the function `putchar`
* `8-print_base16.c`: prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. Use only the function `putchar`
* `9-print_comb.c`: prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers
* `100-print_comb3.c`: prints all possible smallest combinations of two digits
* `101-print_comb4.c`: prints all possible smallest combinations of three digits using `putchar` function only 6 times maximum
