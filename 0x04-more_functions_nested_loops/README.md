# 0x02 C - functions, nested loops

In this project, I will explore more functions and nested loops.

## What each scripts do?

* `0-isupper.c`: checks for uppercase character
* `1-isdigit.c`: checks for a digit (`0` through `9`)
* `2-mul.c`: multiplies two integers
* `3-print_numbers.c`: prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line
