# 0x02 C - functions, nested loops

In this project, I will explore functions and nested loops.

## What each scripts do?

* `0-putchar`: program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line. And return `0` to the standard output.
* `1-alphabet.c`: prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`: prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line
* `3-islower.c`: checks for lowercase character:
  * Returns `1` if the input is a character
  * Returns `0` otherwise
* `4-isalpha.c`: checks for alphabetic character:
  * Returns `1` if the input is a letter; lowercase or uppercase
  * Returns `0` otherwise
* `5-sign.c`: prints the sign of a number
  * Returns `1` and prints `+` if `n` is greater than zero
  * Returns `0` and prints `0` if `n` is zero
  * Returns `-1` and prints `-` if `n` is less than zero
* `6-abs.c`: computes tha absolute value of an integer
* `7-print_last_digit.c`: prints the last digit of a number and also returns it.
* `8-24_hours.c`: prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59
