# 0x02 C - functions, nested loops

In this project, I will explore functions and nested loops.

## What each scripts do?

* `0-putchar`: program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line. And return `0` to the standard output.
* `1-alphabet.c`: prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`: prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line
* `3-islower.c`: checks for lowercase character:
  * Returns `1` if the input is a character
  * Retunrs `0` otherwise
