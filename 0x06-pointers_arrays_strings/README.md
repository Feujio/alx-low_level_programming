# 0x06 C - More Pointers, arrays and strings

In this project, I will explore more pointers, arrays and strings.

## What each scripts do?

* `0-strcat.c`: concatenates two strings
* `1-strncat.c`: concatenates two strings with at most n bytes from the source string
* `2-strncpy.c`: copies a string
