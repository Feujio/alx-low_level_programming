# 0x00 C Hello World

In this project, I will explore the basics of C programming

## What each scripts do?

* 0-preprocessor: runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file
* 1-compiler: compiles a C file but does not link.
  * The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
  * The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c.
    * Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.o
